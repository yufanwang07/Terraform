<h1>$ terraform --version</h1>

<p><br></p>
<h1>$ sudo ./terraform</h1>
<p>[&gt;_Ter]raform is an <span style="color:#6AFF00">in-development retro-minimalistic platformer</span> featuring and eventual horror elements and a twist on a <span style="color:#6AFF00">bullet-hell style gameplay</span>&mdash;instead of taking damage, bullets push you.&nbsp;The game has&nbsp;2 modes: story mode and level select.&nbsp;Level select is unlocked after the completion of story mode.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h1>$ sudo help</h1>
<p>To figure out how to use the terminal, you can run <span style="color:#6AFF00">help</span> or <span style="color:#6AFF00">sudo help</span> for more detailed instructions. Here's the commands you may use:<br></p>
<p><span style="color:#6AFF00">sudo help</span> &mdash; Displays this information in game.<br>
<span style="color:#6AFF00">sudo add --[type] [dx] [dy]</span> &mdash; Creates [type] at &lt;[dx], [dy]&gt; from player.<br>
<span style="color:#6AFF00">sudo move [ID] [dx] [dy]</span> &mdash; Moves entity with id [ID] a by &lt;[dx], [dy]&gt;.<br>
<span style="color:#6AFF00">sudo destroy [ID]</span> &mdash; Destroys entity with id [ID].</p>
<p>The terminal will be introduced in the tutorial as well. Try to only use aspects of the game introduced when completing the tutorial&mdash;as the tutorial is meant for new players, trying to work around it may break the game.&nbsp;The assistant will walk you through the remainder of the controls. Here's a quick list:</p>
<p>Arrow keys to move/jump. Holding up arrow lets you jump higher.<br>Press Tab to dash.<br>Left shift at beginning to skip tutorial.<br>Left shift to spawn a temporary platform.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(STORY MODE ONLY, UNLOCKED IN PLOT)<br>X to destroy a nearby enemy-created&nbsp;entity.&nbsp; (STORY MODE ONLY, UNLOCKED IN PLOT)</p>
